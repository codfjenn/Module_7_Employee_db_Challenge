# Employee Review 

## Overview of Employee Review
### A Review of employee data to determine the resource that will be retiring in the near future. The review included multiple data sources to provide us employee's name, employee's date of birth, employee's title, Employee's department, and employee's start and end date with their job title. After identifying the reosurces that we anticipated to retire, we completed an additional analysis for potential replacements. 

## Employee Review Results
Below is a sumamary of the items identified fromt he analysis deliverables: 
- A total of 300,024 employees were included in this data set. Of the total employee population, 72,464 employees were identified as being expected to retire in the near future. Therefore, about 24% of the companies workforce is anticipated to retire (72,464 / 300,0024). 
- The two roles most significantly impacted job titles by the upcoming retirees are Senior Engineer and Senior staff. These two roles are about 70% of the upcoming retirees. 
- We identified a total of 1,149 empoyees that would be eligible for mentorship program. Within the mentorship population we have identified employees based on date of birth that we view as potential candidates. 
- The mentorship program should review the employees listed in the data to determine if there are any employees that we see as potential promotions. Currently, we have 313 Engineers that should be reviewed to see if they can backfill the Senior Engineer retirees and 432 Staff that could potentially backfill for Senior Staff. 

## Employee Review Summary
Based on a review of the employee data, the organization will have to backfill 72,464 roles. The organization does not currently have enough resourcing based on date of birth to mentor the next generation. The organization only has 1,149 employees that they consider eligible for the mentorship.

Below are two additional analysis that were completed to review the data further: 
- An additional query was added to the mentorship data by role. This detail identifies that we have several staff and resource engineers that should be reviewed to determine if they are eligible for senior staff roles. Below is a table summary

- With the concerns around the voume of additional resources to mentor, the population was expanded to 1964-01-01 through 1965-12-31. This additional analysis allowed us to identify a total mentorship population of 19,905. This population would allow us to be more selective when identifying the appropriate resources.
